1.My home page consists of a hero section where I can have a video playing in the background with text and a button over it that allows you to go to the mattresses. At the top of the page, I have a navbar that I customized to have my brand logo and the two options of pages you could go to either about or mattresses.

My product page has the same navbar as the home page but below it has 12 different products that tell you the price range and bring you to where you can buy it from.

2. Using bootstrap changed my programming experience by giving me a lot of new options that I could use and improve the aesthetics of my code.

3. I tried to be very closely follow my MVP plan so I could finish with room to improve and have time for feedback

4.I’m most proud of my home page and how it looks. I’m also proud of how I used the components.

5.If I had more time I would like to thoroughly polish both my navbar and product page to make them even better.
